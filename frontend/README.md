# Frontend

Frontend is build on Vue with help of vue-cli. It was my first Vue project so I needed some boilerplate code to start with and build it in one day. It also uses bootstrap 4 for some styling.

## Startup

First of all - install dependensies: `npm install`

Then:

- Run in dev mode: `npm run serve`
- Build production version: `npm run build`
